SQL Practice Roadmap - Phase Listing
📊 Phase 1: Foundation (4-6 weeks)
1. BASIC SQL SYNTAX
✅ SELECT statements

✅ WHERE clause for filtering data

✅ Sorting with ORDER BY

✅ AS for aliasing columns/tables

✅ Limiting results with TOP (SQL Server equivalent of LIMIT)

2. DATA CLEANING
✅ DISTINCT to remove duplicates

✅ Filtering with multiple conditions (AND, OR, NOT)

✅ Pattern matching with LIKE and wildcards (% and _)

✅ CASE WHEN statements

✅ Handling NULL values with COALESCE/ISNULL

✅ BETWEEN & IN for range filtering

✅ CAST & CONVERT for data type conversion

3. DATA AGGREGATION
✅ Common aggregate functions: SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX

✅ GROUP BY for grouping data

✅ HAVING clause for filtering grouped data

✅ Nested aggregations

✅ Checkpoint 1: Practice with EASY questions

🔗 Phase 2: Table Relationships (2-4 weeks)
4. COMBINING TABLES
✅ Understanding relational databases

✅ Basic joins:

INNER JOIN

LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN in SQL Server)

RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN in SQL Server)

FULL OUTER JOIN

SELF JOIN

✅ CROSS JOIN for cartesian products

✅ Combining datasets with:

UNION

UNION ALL

EXCEPT

INTERSECT

✅ Checkpoint 2: Practice with MEDIUM questions + EDA project

📈 Phase 3: Advanced Analysis (4-8 weeks)
5. WINDOW FUNCTIONS
✅ OVER() and PARTITION BY

✅ Window frames with ROWS BETWEEN and RANGE BETWEEN

✅ Ranking functions:

ROW_NUMBER()

RANK()

DENSE_RANK()

✅ Navigation functions:

LAG()

LEAD()

FIRST_VALUE()

LAST_VALUE()

✅ NTILE for bucketing

✅ PERCENT_RANK for percentile calculations

✅ Aggregate functions with windows (SUM, AVG over partitions)

6. SUBQUERIES & CTEs
✅ Simple subqueries

✅ Correlated subqueries

✅ Common Table Expressions (CTEs) using WITH

✅ Recursive CTEs for hierarchical data

✅ Multiple CTEs in single query

✅ Checkpoint 3: Complete 10 HARD questions + complex project

🛠️ Phase 4: Data Manipulation (2-4 weeks)
7. DATA MANIPULATION
✅ INSERT data into tables

✅ UPDATE existing records

✅ DELETE records from tables

✅ Defining DEFAULT values

✅ Understanding TRUNCATE vs. DELETE differences

✅ Transaction control (BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK)

✅ Checkpoint 4: End-to-end project with data pipeline

📁 Database Setup (SQL Server Specific)
8. SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT
✅ Creating databases and tables

✅ Data types (INT, VARCHAR, DECIMAL, DATE, DATETIME)

✅ Primary keys and foreign keys

✅ Indexes for performance

✅ Views for abstraction

✅ Stored procedures

✅ User-defined functions
